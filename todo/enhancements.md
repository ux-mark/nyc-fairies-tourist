Two three sections are needed in the site:

## Pre-departure Info
**Visa Waiver**
If you are travelling from outside of the US remember:
- Get your ESTA before or immediately after you buy your flight. 

**Mobile Phone** 
Again if you are from outside of the US:
- Get a mobile data plan either on your own phone (but that can be expensive for roaming) or you can buy a US number for the period you are here. If you have a new smart phone you can simply sign up online for an eSim. 

## Getting Here
**JFK to Penn Station**
On this page we need to display all the images that are in src/images. They must be listed in order and have the ability to add text under each which I will add into the HTML so put placeholder text based on your best guess for now. Remember these need to be mobile responsive, we need to make sure the user can see each image and it's associated text on ths same page. The order of each image in important as it is providing details for the user (in images) on how to get from JFK airport to Jamacia via the Airtrain and then from Jamacia using the LIRR to get to Penn station. 
Information for the user: You need to buy a LIRR ticket. You can either download the MTA Trains app on your phone before you leave home and buy the ticket when you land (you can only buy the ticke for day of travel). Or you can buy a physical ticket at a ticket booth at the station. You can buy one on the train, BUT it will be more expensive. 

**Subway**
We are on the 1 Subway which travels north/south on Manhattan on the west side. Someone will come and pick you up from Penn Station but always remember that you need to get off at 103 or 110 St to get to us. You can also take the 2 and get off at 96, either jump onto the 1 there or just walk. 
Metro just needs a contactless credit card, or you can use Apple or Google Pay. 

**Taxi**
Of course you can just fork out for a taxi if you want, I think the cab fares are capped at $70 (PLUS tolls and tips)
